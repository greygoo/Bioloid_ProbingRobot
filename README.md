Bioloid_ProbingRobot
====================

C implementation of the Robotis taskfile to control the Bioloid Probing Robot model.

This was a three day hacking project to run the Probing Robot model using C. Many features are not implemented like checking battery values, buttons or using LEDs.

Warning: The code is hacked together and is for sure not the most elegant way to do it, The aim was to learn accessing the actators/sensors and to finish within 3 days.
